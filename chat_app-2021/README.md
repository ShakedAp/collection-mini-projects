## Chat Application

Date: Apr 2021.  
A chat application, made for the Cyber class during 11th grade (in a couple of days). Best suited for Windows.  
This program uses tkinter and socket as Libraries.  
Most of the code is documented, so I'll spare you the words.  

How to use:
- Run server program.
- Run client program.
- Use the GUI, it is pretty intuitive.
