## Top Down Shooter Game

Date: Jan 2021.  
A simple baseline for a top down shooter game.  
This program uses pygame as a graphics library, and pytmx as a map loader library. Also this project uses other simple python libraries.    
Foreword:  
This is a discontinued project. I am pretty sure this was made in a few days when I had COVID-19, and was forced to stay in my room.  
So, this was probably made during January of 2021 (I think).  
I made a lot of top down shooters in Unity and Java, during 8th and 9th grade. Hopefully I will find those as well.  
In the images folder there are many "trash" object and\or maps. I had those laying around when I played with the map creation.  

How to use:
- WASD for movement.
- Space for dash.
- Q for dropping and picking up guns.
- Left mouse button for shooting.
