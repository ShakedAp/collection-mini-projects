## Platformer Game

Date: 2021, Jan-Feb.  
A simple baseline for a platformer game.  
This program uses pygame as a graphics library, and pytmx as a map loader library. Also this project uses other simple python libraries.  
Foreword:  
This is a discontinued project. I am pretty sure this was made in a few days in Jan 2021 (maybe when I had COVID-19).  
THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK.  
When I developed it I stored the map objects on the desktop, for some reason. When I backed up the project I completly forgot about this. Then I switched OS and the files are lost. Because of that the project, in the current state, is not useable.  
On another note though, I think the assets IMAGES are still in the folder, but not in the correct form. So it is maybe fixeable, and probably not very difficult. Another fix could just be switching the map and the assets, it should still work completly fine.  


How to use:
- WASD for movement.
- Arrow to draw slash.
