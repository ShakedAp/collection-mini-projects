## Manipulated Bingo Game

Date: 2020.  
A bingo word-document generator. The bingo boards generated using this program all share one pre-determined number, so everyone can win at the same time.  
I remember that I created this program after I heard my father told me that Lior Suchard did a 'magic' like this to them at work, and I wanted to recreate this.  
This program uses some word libraries that I don't remember :), because this was a long time ago.  

How to use:
- Change the values of the variables inside of the program code.
- Run the files.
