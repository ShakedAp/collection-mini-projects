## A* Algorithm Visualization

Date: 2022.  
A visualization for the search alogrithm A*.  
This program uses pygame as a graphics library, and the algorithm is coded in pure python.  

How to use:
- Drag start / end to change it's position.
- F to show grid and values.
- Space or Return to switch between view modes.
- R to reset the board
- D to shuffle the board and create a random pattern.
- W to show the search in action (Still buggy...).
